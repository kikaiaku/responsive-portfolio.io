                <p>My name is Tom Scarborough. I have been working at Harris Teeter for 15 years now as an assistant market manager. My goals in life are to be able to live a healthy life, and have a family. I want to be able to live life without fear of being able to pay the bills. My hobbie is creating art on the side, and creating code based games. I am married with 3 furr babies.
